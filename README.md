This was the last project for the FCC HTML and CSS responisve web design certification course. I made my page responsive with media queries and learned how to use different units such as vw vh and rem to help make the layout more responsive. I applied a cool hover on my picture to change the color.
(*the current picture is not that great, I will eventually get it updated). 

I am currently learning Javascript and will start learning SASS and bootstrap accordingly!
